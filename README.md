# Job_Search

Python3 program to help job seekers compare CV/Resumes to online job description postings.

The program requires two (2) inputs:
  (1) a CV/Resume in a .doc, .docx, or .txt format
  (2) the URL for the Job Description

Two (2) individual lists are compiled of all words greater than three (3) characters in each input.

Then, a combined, new list is created with all common terms across both lists.  This is displayed to the user.

Lastly, a percentage "score" is displayed to the user.  This calculation divides the CV/Resume created list by the Job Description list.  The higher the percentage the more words a CV/Resume that are present in the Job Description.

Feedback and improvement ideas are always welcomed: info@appkall.com
